# HandwrittenDigitRecognition
My first Machine Learning project where in I have made a convolutional neural network to detect handwritten digits, with the help of MNIST dataset. 
I drew digits from 0 to 9 on my own using MS Paint for testing. 
Achieved an accuracy of 98%.
Layers Used : Conv2D, 0.1 Dropouts, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, etc.
